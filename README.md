# NintendyShop
A tool to download all encrypted Shop files. This tool has no ability to decrypt the files and you need a valid ticket to decrypt them with other tools.

It downloads around 5 TB of data and has zero security checks for drive space or similar! You can reduce the amount of files downloaded / choose what to download by deleting the .hex files or by removing IDs inside them.

A good overview about the IDs can be found here:

# Requirement:

wget.exe in the same directory as the hex files and the downloader.
